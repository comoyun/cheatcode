# About

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems I've solved as part of my preparation for interviews with FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other tech companies. The goal is to document my progress and learn from the solutions shared by the community.

# Utilities

I usually work in the terminal, so I made some CLI tools to make things easier.
They're all in the `/utils/` folder.
You can run them from the project root using `npm run <script>`.
